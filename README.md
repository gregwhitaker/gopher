A self-hosted Google "go" short-links system.

## What are "go" short-links?
Have you ever messaged a coworker to ask for the obscure link to some internal system? We all have. Google
had this issue as well and introduced an internal system where employees could create easily remembered short-links to
important corporate information and systems called "go" links. For instance, if you wanted to see your paystub in the 
HR system, you simply directed your browser at http://go/paystubs and you would be redirected to your paystub information
in the internal HR system.
